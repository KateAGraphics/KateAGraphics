- 👋 Hi, I’m Kate
- 👀 I’m interested in game making, mostly the art side; graphic design, concept art and 3D.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about concept art and all things related with 3D production.
- 💞️ I’m already in a full-time contract as a graphic designer and head of testing
  but I'm always interested for limited-time additions to my schedule as long as they fit it and get me out of my comfort zone for a new adventure.
- 📫 You can reach me by PM me on ArtStation: https://www.artstation.com/katealbi
